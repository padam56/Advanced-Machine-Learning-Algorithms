    "The R-squared metric, also known as the coefficient of determination, is a statistical measure used in machine learning to evaluate the performance of regression models. It quantifies how well the independent variables explain the variance of the dependent variable in a dataset. In machine learning, particularly in regression analysis, R-squared is used to assess how well a model fits data and predicts future outcomes. It helps in comparing different models to determine which one best explains the variability in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "R-squared only measures how well variables predict each other and does not imply causation between them. R-squared is a measure of goodness of fit, not a measure of the quality of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Causation refers to a relationship between two variables where a change in one variable directly results in a change in another variable. This implies a cause-and-effect relationship, meaning that one event (the cause) is responsible for producing another event (the effect).\n",
    "\n",
    "Range: The R-squared value ranges from 0 to 1. A value closer to 1 indicates that a larger proportion of variance is explained by the model, suggesting a better fit. Conversely, a value closer to 0 indicates that the model does not explain much of the variance in the dependent variable134.\n",
    "\n",
    "A high R-squared value does not necessarily indicate a good model. It can sometimes be misleading, especially if overfitting occurs, where the model captures noise rather than underlying patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation: An R-squared value of 1 means that the model perfectly explains all the variability of the response data around its mean. An R-squared value of 0 means that the model does not explain any of the variability23. For example, an R-squared value of 0.7 implies that 70% of the variance in the dependent variable is predictable from the independent variables7.\n",
